%><h3>About ROT13</h3>
<p>ROT13 is one of the single transliteration ciphers that encrypts by replacing the characters in the text with other characters.</p>
<p>Character replacement is performed by shifting the characters from "A" to "Z" by 13 characters out of the 26 characters of "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".</p>
<p>For example, "A" is encrypted to "N" and "Z" is encrypted to "M".</p>

<pre>Plain : ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher: NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM</pre>

<pre>Plain text : THIS IS A SECRET MESSAGE
Cipher text: GUVF VF N FRPERG ZRFFNTR</pre>

<p>Since there is reciprocity that plaintext can be obtained by encrypting ciphertext again, decryption can be done in the same flow as encryption.</p>
